# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world within the last seven days. To complete this project, an API is used to access an URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) website and is retrieved showcasing geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes data which is added to a map. JavaScript and the D3.js library are used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through the API request and created an interactive tool for the visualized earthquake data.

## The Deliverables
* 1 - Add tectonic plate data to overlay on the map with the earthquake data and set the LineString data to stand out on the map
* 2 - Add major earthquake data to overlay on the map with color, set the radius circle based on the magnitude, and add a popup marker for each earthquake to displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake
* 3 - Add a third map style to the earthquake map (I used the dark mode to contrast with the blue tectonic plate lines!)
